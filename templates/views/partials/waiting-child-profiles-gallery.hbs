				<p class="card-details__paragraph">We invite you to get to know some of the dynamic children and
					teens who are waiting for adoption in Massachusetts.  All of the children profiled below are
					in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families, have a goal of
					adoption, and are waiting for a family to call their own.  Siblings profiled are in need of
					a family who can provide them a home together.  Please consider these profiles merely an
					introduction to the child.  We respect the privacy of children and do not list medical or
					mental health issues, nor are we able to capture the full strengths and personality of
					the child.  To learn more about a specific child or sibling group, please submit a Request
					for Information Form.   A MARE staff person will respond to your inquiry with additional
					details, and if appropriate connect you with the childâ€™s social worker.</p>

				<p class="card-details__paragraph">The profiles below are limited to those children or sibling
					groups who have been legally freed for adoption.  If you are a New England or New York family
					with a current, approved homestudy for foster care adoption, you can submit your homestudy
					for verification, allowing you access to an additional pool of waiting children who have not
					yet been legally freed.  To submit your homestudy for verification, contact
					<a href="mailto:dianet@MAREinc.org">Diane Tomaz</a>.</p>
